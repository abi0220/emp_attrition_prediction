A Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Models for Precise Employee Attrition Prediction using python

Employee attrition is a major concern for the business as humans one of the most essential
resource for businesses . Employee attrition occurs due to many reasons, and it is difficult for 
the HR manager to be knowing of such cautioning signals ahead of time . Due to certain 
factors like the interruption of ongoing projects, cost of re-hiring and retraining employees, 
and the possibility of losing key technologies, this places a cumbersome burden on the 
business. 

This project proposes a model for estimating employee attrition and consists of 14 
prediction models of which 11 are Single models and 3 are Ensemble models. 35 factors from 
the 1,470 records of the dataset that have an impact on employee attrition are used.
